Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is designed to enhance user experience by providing personalized movie suggestions. It uses various machine learning techniques to analyze user behavior and movie attributes, ensuring that each recommendation is tailored to the user's unique tastes.

Features
Collaborative Filtering:
User-User Collaborative Filtering
Item-Item Collaborative Filtering
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on metadata such as name.
Hybrid Model: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.
Scalability: Efficiently handles large datasets.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface for discovering new movies.
Benefits
Personalized User Experience: Tailored recommendations increase user satisfaction.
Increased User Retention: Engaging and relevant content keeps users coming back.
Enhanced Engagement: Users explore more movies, increasing platform interaction.
Revenue Growth: Higher engagement leads to more subscriptions, rentals, and purchases.
Actionable Insights: Data on user preferences guides content strategy and acquisition.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone (https://github.com/Bamidaletech/MovieRecommendationSystem).git
cd movierecommendationsystem
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset:

Download the MovieLens dataset from MovieLens.
Place the dataset files in the data/ directory.
Usage
Data Preprocessing:

Run the data preprocessing script to clean and merge data:
bash
Copy code
python preprocess_data.py
Train the Model:

Train the recommendation models:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Generate Recommendations:

Use the trained model to generate movie recommendations:
bash
Copy code
python recommend.py --user_id <USER_ID> --num_recommendations <NUMBER_OF_RECOMMENDATIONS>
Dataset
This project uses the MovieLens dataset. Ensure you have the movies.csv and ratings.csv files in the data/ directory.

Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the recommendation system, use the evaluation script:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py
This will output metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to help assess the accuracy of the recommendations.
